## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install shaduxe/ui Components

To integrate shaduxe/ui into your project, use the `shadcn CLI` to install any component from the shaduxe/ui registry. 

Run the following command:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://ui.shaduxe.com/r/[component-name]"
```

- Replace `[component-name]` with the specific component you want to install (e.g., `button`, `avatar`, `tabs`).
- This will automatically download and configure the selected component for your project.

### Step 2: Customizing Components

1. After installation, locate the component files in your `components` directory.
2. Modify styles and variants using your preferred styling approach (e.g., TailwindCSS or CSS-in-JS).
3. Extend functionality by adding new props or utility hooks as needed.

### Example: Adding a Button

To add a `button` component, run:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://ui.shaduxe.com/r/button"
```

This will:
- Download the `button` component and its dependencies.
- Register it in your project for immediate use.

Once installed, use it in your application like this:
```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/button";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <Button variant="outline">
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```
